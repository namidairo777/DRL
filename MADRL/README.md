# MADRL
Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning
## First simple task - pursuit (1 target , n pursuers)
The goal of this task is similiar to my [previous multi-agent project](https://github.com/namidairo777/xiao_multiagent). However, this time we focus on AGI (artificial general intelligence).
### How to create this multi-agent oriented environment to test our algorithm for MA
- Based on OpenAI gym
	- Reward
	- Env
	- Observation
